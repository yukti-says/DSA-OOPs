//macros in c/cpp are a part of code where its name is replaced with given value. macros does not consume memory and is pre compliled before the code
//making it more efficient for our program and many more
/*
#define pi 3.14 -> this will replace pi with 3.14 value where ever the pi is written in program

INLINE FUNCTION: is same as macros but for functions, its efficient to make function inline if that is just one line of function
inline int sum(int i)
{
  return i*i;
  }
